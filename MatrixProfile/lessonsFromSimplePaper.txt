The evaluation of different choices of feature sets is not
the focus of this paper. For this reason, we fixed the use
of chroma-based features in our experiments. This kind of
features is prevalent in many music retrieval and data mining
tasks. Specifically, we used the chroma energy normalized
statistics (CENS) [14] to provide local tempo invariance. These
features rely on applying a Hanning window on consecutive
windows of “raw” chroma and aggregate features among the
window to smooth the temporal chroma variation and reduce
the dimensionality of the examples.
